    "text": "3.2 Interpret and use statistical concepts\n\nReadings and videos (every week)\nI favor a “flipped classroom,” as it gives you more time to clarify and solidify statistical concepts through hands-on exercises. Each week, you will read the required chapter(s), completing a required reading guide to walk you through the central concepts for each week. You are required to submit your completed reading guides by the start of class on Monday.\n\n\nConcept quizzes (every week)\nEach week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key concepts from the week’s readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish. The quizzes are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You are required to complete the concept quiz by the start of class on Monday.\n\n\nTutorials (every week)\nYou can think of the tutorials as an “interactive” textbook, as they interweave statistical ideas alongside examples of how to work with data in R and hands-on exercises writing the R code necessary to complete a given task. Each exercise has hints available if you get stuck!\nThe tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so you are required to complete each week’s tutorial before Wednesday’s lab.\nThe tutorials are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You will submit a screenshot of the completion page at the end of the tutorial to confirm that you completed the tutorial for the week. You are required to complete the tutorial by the start of class on Thursday."

Critiques are due roughly 1-week after they are assigned and should take 1-2 hours. You will receive feedback and a mark of Success or Growing (elaborated more on later), and you will be able to revise based on that feedback. There will be two total critiques."

    "text": "3.4 Perform statistical analyses to answer research questions\n\nLab Assignments (every week)\nLabs will be assigned on Thursday every week, providing the opportunity to explore the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials are due before the start of class on Wednesday.\nYou will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with in class. You will access the lab assignment through Posit Cloud, which you will be walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to submit your completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit only the HTML document (not the Quarto document). The individual assigned as the Report Manager (described below) will submit the team’s completed Lab assignment by Monday at 5pm.\n\nSuccess / Growing Grading\nI expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for “proficiency” of specific learning targets, which describe what you should be able to do after taking this course. You’ll receive a score for each problem on an assignment according to the Success / Not Yet rubric below, as well as feedback to help you improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nJustification\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nThe solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error does not bring into question your understanding of the topic.\n\n\nGrowing\nThe solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, elements of the solution bring into question your understanding of the topic, and thus further attention is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting Revisions\nEvery week, your Lab assignment and / or Statistical Critique from the previous week will be graded and returned to you no later than Wednesday at 9am. Meaning, Lab 2 (completed in Week 2) will be graded and returned to you by Wednesday of Week 3. After the first submission of your Lab or Critique you will have the option to retry any problems for which you scored a Growing (G). A written reflection on how your understanding of the problem changed will accompany any revision.\nRevisions for a Lab or Critique are due on Wednesdays at 5pm, one week from when they were returned. If you do not complete your revision within one week of when it was returned, you are no longer permitted to submit a revision. If you don’t earn a Success by your second revision, you are expected to make an appointment with me to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a reassessment strategy.\n\n\nReflections on Your Learning\nRevisions must include a reflection describing how you revised your thinking when completing your revision. It’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—you have to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from an introductory statistics class, but I think you’ll get the idea.\n\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of who has outstanding revisions.\n\n\n\nPeer Evaluations\nFor quite some time I have been interested in what we, as your professors, can do to make group collaborations better for every student.\nFollowing the lab assignment each week you are required to complete a short (4-question) survey regarding your experiences collaborating with your partner. I use these evaluations to gauge people’s collaborative experiences and to identify any instances where it would be beneficial to change groups or meet 1-1 with group members.\nOn Wednesdays, I will bring personalized paper evaluation slips (with your name on it) to class. Once your group has finished the lab, you can come up and grab your evaluation slip. I ask that you take 3-minutes to thoughtfully respond to each of the questions. Your responses do not influence your grade or your partner’s grade, but I ask that you take them seriously."

Each project will be done independently, and requires you to submit a project proposal and draft report before the final deadline.

The heat capacity of the atmosphere is about \\(10^7\\) J/(K\\(\\cdot\\) m\\(^2\\)).\n(Hint: It’s not much, so you can make some assumptions that make things easier! What radiation, if any, is coming into the top of the atmosphere? What radiation, if any, is going out? )\n\n\nExercise 2: Budyko’s Model\nSatellite data suggests that blackbody radiation might not be the best model for Earth’s outgoing radiation! Instead, we can use a linear(-ish) model: \\(A + BT_s\\). (The ish is because \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) depend on temperature if we’re being careful, as we’ll consider in Parts (c) and (d).)\n\nPart (a)\nModify Model 1 to use this form for Earth’s outgoing radiation instead, and find an expression for surface temperature in this case. We’ll call this temperature \\(T_0\\).\n\n\nPart (b)\nSuppose that \\(S_0\\) changes slightly by an amount we’ll call \\(\\Delta S\\). If \\(\\alpha, A,\\) and \\(B\\) don’t change, write an expression for \\(\\Delta T\\), how much \\(T_s\\) changes.\n\n\nPart (c)\nSuppose now that \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A\\), and \\(B\\) do change with temperature as follows: \\[\n    \\begin{align*}\n        \\alpha(T) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\Delta T; \\\\\n        A(T) = A_0 + A_1 \\Delta T; \\\\\n        B(T) = B_0 + B_1 \\Delta T;\\\\\n    \\end{align*}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_0, A_0, B_0\\) are the values when \\(T = T_0\\). Find an expression relating \\(\\Delta S\\) to \\(\\Delta T\\). You can assume that \\((\\Delta T)^2 \\approx 0\\).\n\n\nPart (d)\nWith some wrangling of terms, you can get this to look like \\[B_0 \\Delta T = f (1- \\alpha_0) \\Delta S,\\] with \\(f\\) condensing a pretty messy expression. Compare this to your answer to (b). Why do you think \\(f\\) is called ``climate gain?”\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nREADING QUESTION HERE"
